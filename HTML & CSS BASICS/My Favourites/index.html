          Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
          The goal of Minecraft is to give players access to a virtual sandbox where they can explore, create, and survive. The game's strong community 
          and open-ended gameplay have made it popular with people of all ages and helped it become one of the most successful video games ever.

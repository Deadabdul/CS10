                Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed
                by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005
                at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine.
                The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety
                of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms.

                Although Unity is a native C++-built game engine.
                You write code in C#, JavaScript (UnityScript) or,
                less frequently, Boo. But the large majority of Unity
                developers use C#.

                Rather than going in blind, Unity comes with a powerful
                scripting API that offers you quick access to the most
                commonly needed features. This includes both general game
                features, as well as specific API calls that allow you to
                access specific features and nuances for the engine. For
                example, you can use serialized fields to change the field values
                (like ints, strings, etc.) in the game editor gui.

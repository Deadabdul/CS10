                Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed
                by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005
                at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine.
                The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety
                of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms

                Unity is a native C++-based game engine.
                You write code in C#, JavaScript (UnityScript) or,
                less frequently, Boo. But the large majority of Unity
                developers use C#

                Unity offers a very transparent method
                for composing your game architecture. Each “level” in a
                Unity game project is divided into a Scene, and each
                scene contains all the game objects needed for the player
                to use the level – whether that’s the background, player
                character, enemy, bullet, or something else.
